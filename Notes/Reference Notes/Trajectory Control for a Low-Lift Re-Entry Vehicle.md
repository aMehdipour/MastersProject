## Notes

- Vehicle must be able to fly within its own safety limits
- Must be able to respond to off-nominal entry conditions
- In the past, trajectory control was mainly based on path prediction, in which the controller computes a new trajectory in advance based on the actual flight conditions, and path following, in which the controller tries to reach a predetermined trajectory.
- Traditionally, reference trajectories are selected from the acceleration - velocity plane, since range can be expressed as the integral of drag over velocity. Thus, measuring velocity, a vehicle is guided to the desired final state by scheduling drag or vertical acceleration
